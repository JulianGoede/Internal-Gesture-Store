# Internal-Gesture-Store
A very simple way to store gestures drawn by
user in a file, which GestureLibrary has access to.

Hi,
my name is Julian Goede and this is the first project I share on GitHub. It is mainly created, so that I can pracitce
the basics of the GestureOverlayView and storing gestures internally.
